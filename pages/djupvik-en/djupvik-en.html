      <p>
        The Port of Djupvik is located on the east coast of Gotland very close
        to the beautiful smaller island Lilla Karlsö. Adjacent to the port is
        a small and charming fishing-village which, during summer, comes to
        life with a relaxed and welcoming buzz. Close by and situated with a
        fantastic view over the port is Djupvik Hotel, with modern standard
        and with its own popular restaurant. Both the port and the fishing
        village have a beautiful view of two popular bird islands called
        “Lilla Karlsö” and “Stora Karlsö”.

        The coastline south of Djupvik, called “Ekstakusten” is incredibly
        beautiful and invites to nice scenery and views on foot, by bike or by
        car. North, and connected to the port, is a small sandy beach which is
        well soothed for a nice swim. The distance from the port to Lilla
        Karlsö is about 2 nautical miles and it is about twice as long to
        Stora Karlsö (4nm). For more information, check out the websites:
        lillakarlso.org and storakarlso.se. For information about Djupvik
